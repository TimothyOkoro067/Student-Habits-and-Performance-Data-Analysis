Student Habits vs. Academic Performance Analysis 

Conducted an in-depth analysis of 1,000 student records to identify key factors influencing academic performance.

Performed data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and correlation analysis to uncover relationships between study habits, lifestyle, and exam scores.

Created interactive visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, 3D plots, and box plots) using Plotly to reveal trends:
  Positive correlation between study hours (4-5 optimal) and exam scores, with diminishing returns.
  7-8 hours of sleep are linked to peak performance, while excessive social media and Netflix usage   negatively impact scores.

  Higher parental education levels, better diet, exercise, and mental health are associated with      improved academic outcomes.

  Derived actionable insights to help educators and students optimize study habits and well-being     for better performance.
